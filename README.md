# Introduction

Indexed on [Test PyPi](https://test.pypi.org/project/covid19-system9)

This is the protocol repository for Opentrons COVID-19 System 9 ([site name]).

The protocol files that you can upload to your OT-2s will be kept here.

In order to avoid errors running local protocol simulations add the ./custom_defaults/*.json files to your ~/.opentrons folder.
